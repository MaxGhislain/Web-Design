    <h1>External CSS - PAGE 1</h1>
    <p>One great thing about using external style sheets is that you can edit as many of your webpages styles from a single css style sheet. For example if you change the color of the H1 above in the style sheet, it will not only change this page, but also the h1 in all the following pages. In other words it is very scalable.</p>
    
    <ol>
    	<li><a href="page1.html">Page 1</a>
    	<li><a href="page2.html">Page 2</a>
    	<li><a href="page3.html">Page 3</a>
    	<li><a href="index.html">Back Home</a>
    </ol>
